ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Tejas! ðŸ‘‹

I develop systems that lie at the intersection of data-driven methods, machine learning, and optimization techniques to uncover actionable insights from complex datasets. My goal is to empower end-users to make informed decisions by effectively communicating data-driven insights. 

# Addressable Technical Details 
When embarking on a new project, I always consider the following questions:

- What are the key objectives and outcomes we aim to achieve?
- How can we leverage data-driven methods to drive actionable insights?
- What are the most effective ways to engage and empower end-users with generated intelligence?
- How can we create reinforcement learning mechanisms within applications to streamline continuous optimization?
- How can we leverage generative AI, LLMs, and foundational models to bring human-interaction to the next level? 
- How can we integrate a source of "truth" into prediction mechanisms, such as physics-informed ML, constraints, and mathematical symmetries?
- How can we improve continuous optimization with programmatic differentiation, where parameterized blocks, automatic differentiation, optimization capabilities adapt to new, real-time conditions?
- How can end-users, customers, viewers, and anyone deriving value communicate & interact best with the AI? 

# User Experiences 

Some user-experiences require transactional insight generations, for example a "click-for-insight" experience. I have also developed systmes for continously trasactional experiences such as automated notifications, signal-detection mechanisms, geo-tag based alerts. Ultimatley, I strongly believe isights serve end-users best with maximized automnomy, customization, a variety of visualizations. For example, at the fictitious corporation 'John Smith Consulting Services, Inc' a developer collaborating with a Sales called "Team A" and Customer Success Developer Team called "Team B" seeks to deliver sophisticated solutions at the intersection of data-driven methods, machine learning, and applied optimization. Sales Team A requires interactive dashboards and data visualization tools, necessitating the integration of SDKs and APIs to facilitate intuitive data exploration and interpretation during research reporting. Conversely, Team B required quick access and interaction with modeled tabular data, requiring the seamless integration of data-flows into exisiting applications. This ensured effortless user engagement and access to data-driven functionalities, enhancing understanding of intricate trends, patterns, and correlations within their datasets. With my focus on data-centric modeling & user-centric design, I strive to optimize decision-making processes by empowering users with powerful, accessible insights. 

## Current Areas of Exploration - An Overview 

- **Systems Modeling & Observability of Complex Systems**

There's immense value in intergrating machine learning, engineering mathematics, and mathematical physics to model, predict control dynamic systems for end-users to act faster, with broader span of contextual insights, saving extrodinary manual efforts. In addition to maintaining clean, computationally-effective data pipelines, I seek to bring data-driven methodologies to enhance predictive accuracy and understanding of complex system behaviors as systems interact with new environemnts & conditions. More specfically, I hope to bring any signal processing system (e.g. Software to Hardware, Computer to Sensor, Software to User) to a level that can interpret dynamic behaviors beyond of low-dimensional pattern recognition, while enabling effective simplification of signals through extraction of patterns, features, parameters, or raw data dervived from non-linear environemnts. Decision making experiences, with collaboration with data-driven transformations, enable users to systemically interpret & interact with data beyond conventional mediums, classification, with highly-succesful parameter inclusion, feature extraction, data/coordinate transformation, memory compression, or retrieval-augmented generation process. 

- **Data-Driven Discovery**
  
Exploring cutting-edge methods and techniques for modeling, prediction, and control of complex systems is becoming more important by the day with data-rich enviornments. The ability to simplfy models with transformations pre-trained with extensive contextual knowledge. Creating deep-knowledge spaces, memory compression kits, and guided discovery processes through math & physics offers increased accuracy in outputs guiding end-users. Data-driven discovery processes such as reduced order models, enable clean interoplation of outputs between employees and raw data, divserse integrated software types, and large-scale connective solutions with an abudance of data collection in frequecy, type, and storage channels. Here are some key elements of an effective data-driven discovery process: 

- Dimensional Analysis and Feature Selection: Uncovering patterns through dimensional analysis and selecting relevant features using probabilistic methods streamline the modeling process.
- Deep-Knowledge Spaces and Memory Compression: By creating deep-knowledge spaces, employing memory compression techniques, and guiding discovery processes through mathematical and physical principles, the accuracy of outputs for end-users is significantly enhanced. 
- Reduced Order Models (ROMs) for Interpolation: Utilizing reduced order models facilitates seamless interpolation of outputs between employees and raw data, enabling effective communication and understanding across diverse integrated software systems.

- **Differential Programming**: I've been implementing this novel software technique for developing highly adaptive and optimized systems.

Differentiable Programming (DP) is a cutting-edge technique that enables the automatic computation of derivatives of model outputs with respect to model parameters. This approach allows for end-to-end differentiation of complex computer programs, including those with control flows and data structures, facilitating gradient-based optimization of program parameters. DP enhances the performance and efficiency of software systems by enabling gradient-based optimization of program parameters. Automatic differentiability is an essential ingredient in the construction of such hybrid models, where generalizes models are parsed combined with intelligence-components that exist externally to a back-end repository. DP techniques create the opportunity to implement adaptive control techniques to handle nonlinear dynamics, where direct relationships are not easy to forecast and model. Due to the complexity and intricate interactions within large-scale systems, using nonlinear dynamics to capture behaviors accurately is crucial! Granting observability over the structure, analysis frameworks, parameter selection, or repository structures can offer organizations an efficient data governance strategy.
