- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Tejas
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the intersection of data-driven methods, machine learning and applied optimization. More specifcally, I have a keen interest in control theory, and non-linear/linear system modeling, and data goverence platforms.

- # Current Focus

**Modeling and Control of Complex Systems**
I'm actively engaged in integrating machine learning, engineering mathematics, and mathematical physics to model and control dynamic systems. My focus is on harnessing data-driven methodologies to enhance predictive accuracy and understanding of complex system behaviors across diverse domains.

**Data-Driven Discovery**
I'm deeply intrigued by the transformative potential of data-driven discovery. My current endeavors involve exploring cutting-edge methods and techniques that enable the modeling, prediction, and control of complex systems. From finance to robotics, I'm passionate about uncovering insights that drive meaningful impact.
