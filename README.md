ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Tejas! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the intersection of data-driven methods, machine learning, and applied optimization. How can we extract meaningful insights from data? How is "meaning" interpreted by end-users? While curating the correct prediction mechanisms or engineering the appropriate feature extraction mechanisms, how the intelligence is utilized is equally as crucial. Therefore, most of my projects are supported with interactive channels for end-users such as interactive dashboards, data-visualization packages (such as hvPlot) or embedded data-flows.

# Questions I Ask for Every Project
When embarking on a new project, I always consider the following questions:

- What are the key objectives and outcomes we aim to achieve?
- How can we leverage data-driven methods to drive actionable insights?
- What are the most effective ways to engage and empower end-users with generated intelligence?
- How can we create reinformcement learning mechanisms within applications to streamline continous optimization?
- How can we leverage generative AI, LLMs & and foundational models to bring human-interaction to the next level? 
- How can we integrate a source of "truth" into prediction mechanisms, such as physics-infromed ML, constraints, and mathemtical symmetries?
- How can we improve continous optimization with programmatic differentiation, where parametrerized blocks, automatic differentiation, optimization capabilities adapt to new, real-time conditions?
- How can end-users, customers, viewers, and anyone deriving value communicate & intereact best with the AI? 

# Current Focus

**Modeling and Control of Complex Systems**
I'm deeply immersed in integrating machine learning, engineering mathematics, and mathematical physics to model and control dynamic systems. My focus lies in harnessing data-driven methodologies to enhance predictive accuracy and understanding of complex system behaviors across diverse domains.

**Data-Driven Discovery**
I'm fascinated by the transformative potential of data-driven discovery. My current endeavors involve exploring cutting-edge methods and techniques that enable the modeling, prediction, and control of complex systems. From finance to robotics, I'm passionate about uncovering insights that drive meaningful impact and empower decision-makers with actionable intelligence.

**Differential Programming**
A novel type of software by assembling networks of functional blocks that are adjustable and trainable. These "functional blocks" achieve this by training these networks with examples using optimization methods based on gradients. This approach resembles traditional programming, with the key differences being that it involves parameterized blocks, automatic differentiation, and optimization capabilities. I firmly believe that the adoption of differential programming techniques will catalyze groundbreaking advancements across various domains. By integrating these methods, we can develop highly adaptive and optimized systems, such as personalized healthcare algorithms capable of tailoring treatments based on individual patient data, or autonomous vehicles equipped with robust learning capabilities to navigate complex environments with unparalleled precision. This approach promises to revolutionize industries, where predictive models can adapt in real-time to market fluctuations, enhancing decision-making processes and maximizing returns on investments.

Feel free to reach out if you share my enthusiasm for these topics or if you'd like to collaborate on a project! Let's embark on a journey of exploration and innovation together.
