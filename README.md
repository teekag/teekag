I'm interested in developing systems that lie at the intersection of data-driven methods, machine learning, and optimization techniques to uncover actionable insights from complex datasets. My goal is to empower end-users to make informed decisions by effectively communicating data-driven insights with transparency. 

# Addressable Technical Details 
When embarking on a new project, I aim to consider the following questions:

- What are the key objectives and outcomes we aim to achieve?
- How can we leverage data-driven methods to drive actionable insights?
- What are the most effective ways to engage and empower end-users with generated intelligence?
- How can we create reinforcement learning mechanisms within applications to streamline continuous optimization?
- How can we leverage generative AI, LLMs, and foundational models to bring human-interaction to the next level? 
- How can we integrate intelligent constants into prediction mechanisms such as PDEs, physics-based constraints, and mathematical symmetries?
- How can we improve continuous optimization with programmatic differentiation, where parameterized blocks, automatic differentiation, optimization capabilities adapt to new, real-time conditions?
- How can end-users, customers, viewers, and anyone deriving value communicate & interact best with the data & insights needed to make a decision?
- If client-server archectectures are "stateless," with no memory storage, what does a better request-response model look like augmented memory storage archectures that can help make real-time conditions easier to dechipher? Does a new request-response improve outcomes & decision making of exisitng model performance?
- What's the "multi-player" mode of an exisiting software tech-stack that can maximizes individual decision making outcomes? 


By prioritizing data-centric modeling and user-centric design principles, my objective is to empower users with potent insights that catalyze informed decision-making. This entails crafting intuitive user interfaces, refining data processing pipelines, and iteratively enhancing algorithms to optimize the overall user experience.

## Current Interest: Data-Driven Optimization Techniques  

**Systems Modeling & Observability of Complex Systems**

There's great value in intergrating machine learning, engineering mathematics, and mathematical physics to model, predict, & control dynamic systems for end-users to act faster. With contextual, interactive, personalized, or customized insight generation systems, time wasted on manual efforts is replaced by more creative and discoverable user-experiences. In addition to maintaining clean, computationally-effective data pipelines, I seek to bring data-driven methodologies to enhance predictive accuracy and understanding of complex system behaviors as systems interact with new environments & conditions. More specfically, I hope to bring any signal processing system (e.g. Software-Hardware, Client-server, Computer to Sensor, Peer-software-Peer, Storage-Sensor) to a level that can interpret dynamic behaviors beyond low-dimensional pattern recognition. In order to effectivly simplify the extraction of patterns, features, parameters, or raw data dervived from non-linear environemnts & communicate value-creating insights end-user experiences must be personalized, customized, and iterated autonomously if possible. Decision making experiences, with collaboration of data-driven transformations, enable users to systemically interact with data beyond conventional mediums where uncertaity levels in outcomes remain unaffected. I strongly believe in mangerial value-creation opportunities derived from data-driven applied optimization techniques. Highly-succesful parameter selection, feature extraction, data/coordinate transformation, memory compression, or retrieval-augmented generation process will lead to smarter decision making. 

**Data-Driven Discovery**

In data-rich environments, exploring advanced methods for modeling, prediction, and control of complex systems is increasingly crucial. Leveraging cutting-edge techniques to simplify models through pre-trained transformations with extensive contextual knowledge is key to achieving accurate outputs that guide end-users effectively. Data-driven discovery processes such as reduced order models, enable clean interoplation of outputs between employees and raw data and large-scale siloed solutions with an abudance in frequecy, type, and storage channels for data collection 

Here are some key elements of an effective data-driven discovery process that I am focusing on: 

- *Dimensional Analysis and Feature Selection:* Uncovering patterns through dimensional analysis and selecting relevant features using probabilistic methods streamline the modeling process.
- *Deep-Knowledge Spaces and Memory Compression:* By creating deep-knowledge spaces, employing memory compression techniques, and guiding discovery processes through mathematical and physical principles, the accuracy of outputs for end-users is significantly enhanced. 
- *Reduced Order Models (ROMs) for Interpolation:* Utilizing reduced order models facilitates seamless interpolation of outputs between humans and raw data, enabling effective communication and understanding of complex datasets. 

**Differential Programming** 

Differentiable Programming (DP) is a technique that enables the automatic computation of derivatives of model outputs with respect to model parameters. Pathmind describes DP as "programs that rewrite themselves at least one component by optimizing along a gradient, like neural networks. "  This approach allows for the potential to build end-to-end differentiation of complex computer programs, including those with control flows and data structures, facilitating gradient-based optimization of program parameters. Automatic differentiability is an essential ingredient in the construction of such hybrid models, where generalizes models are parsed with elements that exist externally to a back-end repository. Parameter blocks are utilized to add structural parameters to a model, enabling the incorporation of additional parameters and defining relationships between different components of the model. DP techniques create the unqiue opportunity to implement adaptive control techniques to handle nonlinear dynamics of physical & non-physical systems, where direct relationships are not easy to forecast and model. Due to the complexity, cost, and intricacies of behaviours within large-scale systems, using nonlinear dynamics to capture behaviors accurately is hard! Granting observability over the structure, analysis frameworks, parameter selection, or repository structures can offer organizations an efficient data governance strategy towards an implementation path. 

**Augmented Memory** 

When augmenting memory storage architectures to enhance real-time conditions in client-server architectures makes senses to apply, developer teams have an opportunity to dechiper data faster without compropmising scalability and reliability. While traditional client-server architectures are stateless, incorporating memory storage in systems can improve the request-response model. By utilizing memory storage, systems can retain critical information, making it easier to decipher real-time conditions and respond more efficiently to user requests. This enhancement allows for better handling of dynamic data and faster processing of requests, ultimately improving the overall performance and responsiveness of client-server, human-software, or developer-model interactions.
