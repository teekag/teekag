ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Tejas! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the intersection of data-driven methods, machine learning, and applied optimization. I believe that the practical applications of these topics are best delivered through value-addition channels or human interaction. How can we extract meaningful insights from data? While curating the correct prediction mechanisms or engineering the appropriate feature extraction mechanisms, how the intelligence is utilized is equally as crucial. Therefore, most of my projects are supported with interactive channels for end-users, such as interactive dashboards or embedded pipelines.

# Questions I Ask for Every Project
When embarking on a new project, I always consider the following questions:

- What are the key objectives and outcomes we aim to achieve?
- How can we leverage data-driven methods to drive actionable insights?
- What are the most effective ways to engage and empower end-users with the generated intelligence?
- How can we create reinformcement learning mechanisms within applications to streamline continous optimization?
- How can we leverage general-intelligence LLMs & and foundational models to bring human-interaction to the next level?
- How can we integrate a source of "truth" into prediction mechanisms, such as physics-infromed ML, constraints, and mathemtical symmetries?

# Current Focus

**Modeling and Control of Complex Systems**
I'm deeply immersed in integrating machine learning, engineering mathematics, and mathematical physics to model and control dynamic systems. My focus lies in harnessing data-driven methodologies to enhance predictive accuracy and understanding of complex system behaviors across diverse domains.

**Data-Driven Discovery**
I'm fascinated by the transformative potential of data-driven discovery. My current endeavors involve exploring cutting-edge methods and techniques that enable the modeling, prediction, and control of complex systems. From finance to robotics, I'm passionate about uncovering insights that drive meaningful impact and empower decision-makers with actionable intelligence.

Feel free to reach out if you share my enthusiasm for these topics or if you'd like to collaborate on a project! Let's embark on a journey of exploration and innovation together.
